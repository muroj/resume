Task: Explain the goal you were trying to achieve or the challenge you needed to overcome.
Action: Detail the specific steps you took to address the situation or task. Be specific about your individual contributions.
Result: Explain the outcome of your actions. Include the results of your work and any lessons you learned. It is often helpful to quantify your results if possible
