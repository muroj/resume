# Restored VM Machine Image Build and Promotion Pipeline

The machine image build/promote pipeline was broken, blocking releases and forcing operators to manually push images across environments.

Actions:

Debugged and repaired image build automation and promotion logic.

Standardized artifact metadata and validation checks.

Exposed a safe, self-service interface for developers to promote images from dev → QA.
Impact:

Restored a critical CI/CD capability and eliminated a recurring operational bottleneck.

Reduced engineering wait times and improved release velocity.
