title: "AWS ALB Upgrade"
---

Owned and Modernized AWS ALB Terraform Module (v6 → v9)

The team relied on an outdated Terraform ALB module that blocked new features and security improvements.

Upgraded module configurations from v6 to v9, resolving breaking changes and new variable requirements.

Wrote a Python script using sh to automate Terraform plan/apply sequences and prevent operator error.

Improved state management and documented safe patterns for future upgrades.
Impact:

Brought ALB configurations to current standards and improved maintainability.

Reduced manual Terraform toil and increased deployment consistency.
