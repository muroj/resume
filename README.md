## Joe Muro

I have over ten years of experience in the IT industry. I began my career at IBM as a software developer for [z/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS), IBM’s flagship operating system for their Z mainframe (yes, mainframes still exist!). This role gave me a strong foundation in software engineering and exposure to a large organization transitioning from traditional waterfall development to lean agile practices.

At the time, IBM's build process literally involved a human manually merging code changes via text editor. Experiencing the pain of those manual integration workflows convinced me there had to be a Better Way. That realization started me on my journey into CI/CD, automation, and DevOps. Since then, I’ve held several roles focused on reducing toil, improving developer workflows, and delivering reliable infrastructure.

Most recently, I’ve been working as an [SRE](https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/), a role that fits my skill set well. I enjoy applying software engineering principles to infrastructure problems—especially work that improves platform reliability, enhances the developer experience, reduces toil, and ultimately delivers real business value.
